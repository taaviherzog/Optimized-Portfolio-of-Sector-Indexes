# Optimized-Portfolio-of-Sector-Indexes
This is a project I began to put to practice ideas I'm learning in class. We use Excel in class, but I'm doing this with Python so I can make use of API-sourced data.

My objective is to determine the optimal percent allocation of a risk-averse portfolio invested in each of the S&P 500 Sector Indexes. This project involves:
- Retrieving data via Yahoo Finance's API **(done)**
- Extrapolating year-over-year returns, expected returns, standard deviations, correlations, and covariances **(done)**
- Portfolio optimization **(done)**

Through this project, I've learned a good deal about using the yfinance API and even about portfolio optimization concepts such as the dirichlet distribution. This has also been a good exercise in beginning to ask questions about the data.
